## Resource ID ##
Automatically generated field containing the EAMENA ID. This should not be manually entered.

## Resource Name(s) ##
There are three available name types:

 1. **Toponym**: All known names, historical and modern, and in any language should be listed, including alternative spellings, if applicable.
 2. **Alternative Reference**: Used to indicate a reference number/site id given to a site in a published or unpublished gazetteer or survey database.
The source of the reference must also be listed as an Information Resource and linked to the record.
 3. **Designation**: Where a site is designated in an official list or register (e.g. UNESCO World Heritage Site), the name/reference under which it is registered should be listed.  World  Heritage Sites should be entered using the format “World Heritage List” plus the list number, e.g. World Heritage List 287. If the site name listed on the World Heritage List differs from the usual toponyms, list it as a separate entry, also with the Designation Type, e.g. “Rock-Art Sites of Tadrart Acacus”. The type of designation must be listed under the resource's 'Designation' field.


## Site Function ##

Overall functional categories recorded at the site:

 1. **Agricultural/Pastoral** Relating to the farming of land and/or the rearing of animals
 2. **Defensive/Fortification**	Relating to the security or protection of people or an area, but not military in nature
 3. **Domestic**	Relating to the habitation of people
 4. **Entertainment/Leisure**	Relating to activities which are largely for pleasure or enjoyment
 5. **Funerary/Memorial**	Relating to activities concerning the memorialisation of individuals, events and/or the treatment of the dead

 10. **Maritime**	Relating to the sea, in particular shipping and/or the exploitation of maritime resources where these resources cannot be further defined.
 11. **Military**	Relating to an organised and/or official group of armed forces
 12. **Public** 	Relating to facilities and services which are intended for use by the community as a whole. Often, but not necessarily officially provided or sanctioned e.g. markets, courthouses, official/government etc.

 14. **Status/Display/Monumental**	Relating to structures which serve no functional purpose except to express a statement, usually relating to wealth, status, power etc.
 15. **Trade/Commercial**	Relating to facilities and or services which are predominantly economically orientated or mercantile in nature.
 16. **Unknown**	Unknown

## Site Function certainty ##

 1. **Not Applicable**	The investigator has entered 'unknown' and certainty does not apply 
 2. **Negligible**	The investigator has considerable reason to doubt their identifications/interpretations. The evidence may also be contradicted by published sources/other imagery specialists or multiple imagery sources.
 3. **Low**	The investigator has considerable reason to doubt their identifications/interpretations. It is not confirmed by published sources/other imagery specialists or multiple imagery sources.
 4. **Medium**	The investigator has some reason to doubt their identifications/interpretations. It is not confirmed by published sources/other imagery specialists or multiple imagery sources.
 5. **High**	The investigator has little reason to doubt their identification, it may or may not be confirmed by published sources/other imagery specialists or multiple imagery sources.
 6. **Definite**	The investigator has no reason to doubt their identification and it is either confirmed by published sources/other imagery specialists or multiple imagery sources.


## Overall site morphology ##

 1. **Negative/Cut/Dug Feature**	A feature which is defined by the natural or man-made creation of a concavity in a surface
 2. **Positive/Built Feature**	A feature which is built/constructed/upstanding from the surface
 3. **Surface Feature**	A feature which appears as surface marks and has no obvious dug or constructed/upstanding components
 4. **Unknown**	Unknown

## Site site shape ##

 1. **Circular**	An enclosed heritage resource which is round in shape
 2. **Curvilinear**	A linear heritage resource which curves
 3. **Irregular**	An enclosed or unenclosed heritage resource with no identifiable geometric form
 4. **Polygonal**	An enclosed heritage resource with 4+ straight sides, not arranged at right angles (e.g. trapezoid, pentagon, hexagon etc.)
 5. **Rectangular/Square**	An enclosed heritage resource with 4 straight sides arranged at right angles
 6. **Rectilinear**	An enclosed or unenclosed heritage resource which is formed of straight sides sitting at more or less right angles
 7. **Semi-circular**	An enclosed heritage resource with one straight side and one curved/rounded side (e.g. D-shaped)
 8. **Straight**	A linear heritage resource which does not curve or bend
 9. **Sub-circular**	An enclosed heritage resource which is rounded in shape, but not necessarily circular
 10. **Sub-rectangular**	An enclosed heritage resource which is rectangular in overall shape but with rounded corners or edges
 11. **Triangular**	An enclosed heritage resource of 3 straight sides.
 12. **User Defined**	Any shape which has been drawn to define the edge of area which is being treated as a single 'site' by the researcher for no other reason than the geographical proximity of heritage resources visible on the imagery (e.g. a large area which contains 1000s of cairns, pendants, and small enclosures, when you have no reason to believe that the individual heritage resources are necessarily related functionally or chronologically, but where we do not want to/cannot enter individual records, for reasons of time. If you use this category, your 'Certainty' for 'Site size/extent' should always be 'Negligible'.
 13. **Winding**	A linear heritage resource which does not follow a regular/straight, and may incorporate bends and/or curves
 14. **Zigzag**	A linear heritage resource which bends in alternating directions at intervals
Unknown	Unknown

## Overall Site Certainty ##

 1. **Negligible**	There is very weak evidence to suggest that the site/feature is archaeological i.e. a placename exists, but there is no corresponding imagery data. There has been no field visit to confirm that the site is not archaeological i.e. natural, but is highly questionable whether the site/feature is of archaeological interest.
 2. **Low**	There is weak evidence to suggest that the site/feature is archaeological. The site/feature may be unclear on imagery or alternative explanations may be probable. This is probably not a site of archaeological interest, although there has been no fieldwork to verify this.
 3. **Medium**	There is evidence to suggest that the site/feature is archaeological. The area has multiple sources of evidence which support each other (e.g. multiple image sets) or is clear enough in a single evidence source to suggest that it is possibly a site of archaeological interest. The area will probably be easy to delimit, but alternative non-archaeological explanations may be possible. There has been no field visit to confirm this interpretation.
 4. **High**	There is strong evidence to suggest that the site/feature is archaeological. The area has multiple sources of evidence that support each other (e.g. multiple image sets) or is clear enough in a single evidence source to suggest that it is a site of archaeological interest. The area will probably be easy to delimit and there are no obvious non-archaeological explanations possible. There has been no field visit to confirm this interpretation.
 5. **Definite**	There is definitive evidence to suggest that the site/feature is archaeological. The site has been visited and it is confirmed that it is a site of archaeological interest. (Published literature/ Field-visit only)
