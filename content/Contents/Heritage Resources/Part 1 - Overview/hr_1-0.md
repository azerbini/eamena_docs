1.Overview and Basic Information about the EAMENA Database and Arches system
===================


The **EAMENA Arches Database** is an online platform to systematically record, view, and search for information about the nature and location of archaeological features, and the disturbances and threats affecting them, from across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Initiated in 2015 and generously funded by the Arcadia Fund (http://www.arcadiafund.org.uk/) and, from 2016, by the British Council's Cultural Protection Fund (), the EAMENA project uses modern and legacy satellite imagery, aerial photography, and published and unpublished data to rapidly assess and record archaeological sites and landscapes that are under threat across this important region. Our spatial database is designed to incorporate basic evidence about each site, including information on the nature and potential dating of archaeological features, as well as any disturbances and threats affecting them. It is hoped that in the future these records will be regularly updated and enhanced with more detailed information by the relevant heritage professionals and institutions in each of the MENA countries, and that it will be a useful tool for long-term heritage management purposes. Although not all disturbances and threats to the archaeology of the MENA region can be prevented, by building up a baseline of knowledge we can enhance already existing knowledge, and by working with local and national authorities to assess site conditions and making detailed records of features that are currently under the most significant threat from modern disturbances such as development, agriculture and conflict, we can help mitigate the effects of these problems in the future. 

Please contact the **EAMENA team** for further details about the project and/or to obtain a user log-in (eamena@arch.ox.ac.uk). Further contact details can be found in **Part 4**.
